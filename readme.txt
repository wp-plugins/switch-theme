== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I see Switch Theme in the list of plugins? =

Switch Theme is only compatible with installations of WordPress which have multisite enabled, so it will only appear under the Plugins list in Network Admin and not the Plugins list in the Site Admin.

= How do I get to Switch Theme after I activate? =

1. There are two easy ways, first is to click `Switch Theme` under the now activated plugin in the Plugins list.
1. Go to the `Themes` menu and click `Switch Theme`. 

= What do I do? =

Once you've made it to the Switch Theme panel choose the desired new theme and click `Switch`, be warned this can take some time, and you cannot undo this change once you press `Switch`.

= How can I get more help? =

I am a pretty busy person but I will do my best to answer questions, so long as they aren't plain obvious, just email me via [my website].
